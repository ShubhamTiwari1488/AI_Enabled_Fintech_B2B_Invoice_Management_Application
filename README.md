# AI Enabled Fintech B2B Cloud Application 

In this project I have created a machine learning model , I have created a backend using Java Servlet , and I have created the frontend using React.JS.
The Database includes more than 10 Lakhs of data . 
The application fetches the data ( Invoices ) from the databases (which is done using the Java Servlet) and is displayed on the screen.

#### As the Database is to large , I am not able to provide it!!!
